3. If action containing message, enter message in "Message : " (Max character cap is 90 and entry box`s size is fit to 60 character) 
4. Click "add action" button to save current action (I want make show this as live, but Tech Issue)
5. when you finished make one line of Dialogue (Need to end with "message action"), click "make file" button to save it
6. If you want more line of dialogue, just do same as above Guide agian. auto line fixer will automatically make multiple lines at file
